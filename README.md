A Trip to the Dentist:

In this audio narrative piece, you are enter the dentist's office, there for a typical check-up just to make sure your pearly whites are all in order. 
You go through the process of talking with the receptionist, spending time in the waiting room, then finally getting to go see the dentist once he's ready.
You'll hear footsteps, alarms, clocks, chairs, tables, drills, etc.

This repository holds an audio narrative piece that I've created that is reminiscent of how someone's trip to the dentist might play out.
